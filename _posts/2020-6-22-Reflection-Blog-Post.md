title: Reflection

Overall, the issues that I'm having with the course really don't have anything to do with the course. I quite enjoy the layout of the course as well as the content. I have noticed myself falling behind in the class, but that really is due to external factors and extenuating circumstances. My father's cancer began to progress again earlier this year right around the time that Covid hit the U.S. and he is now in hospice. So, I'm really trying to do the best I can. 

As far as the content goes, there's nothing I would change. There have been a ton of valuable tools that I really wish that I would have had in previous courses. I'm also looking forward to the Machine Learning portion of the class that I really have no experience with. The biggest issues that I've had so far have been computer technical things such as linking R to Github and figuring out what an API is. The exam went really well and the homeworks/projects have been manageable. I enjoy taking classes with Dr. Post (the last one was 501 and kind of 502) because he is very clear about what he expects. 

Overall, the problems that come up are on me, not the class.
