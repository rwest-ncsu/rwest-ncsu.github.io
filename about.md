Some information about you!

### More Information

Hi there! The fact that it took me **much** more time to write this *little* blurb about me than it did to do my homework says a good bit about me. 

I graduated from UNC last spring and then immediately became a traitor and started my Masters at NC State in the fall. Originally, my ~~girlfriend~~ fianc√©e had planned to be abroad for around a year while she was completing her Masters in Transatlantic Trade and Public Policy at UNC. I had already planned to enroll in the remote Masters program at NCSU to allow me to live anywhere, but her program fit really well with it. I'll give credit where it's due: she's the great planner. She's able to figure out complicated life moves and I'm the one that still thinks it's funny to introduce her as my ex-girlfriend. 

**Enter Covid:**, all those nice plans have been foiled, but there will be some time where we are able to go. Luckily, we're able to spend time with our families until all the madness is over and the grand plan can continue. 

When I'm not doing school work, I enjoy other nerdy things as well. I can't count high enough to list the number of times I have binged Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc. If I could find a Nintendo Switch for a decent price, I'd be all the way through the most recent Pokemon game too. I have a good bit of time on my hands here recently.
